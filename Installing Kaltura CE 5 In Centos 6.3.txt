Kaltura provides different services like Streaming, Transcoding, Advertising, GeoIP, Syndication, Distribution, Security, Monitoring and more. You can easily integrate Kaltura with different Content Management Systems and Learning Management Systems like WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Moodle, Sakai, Blackboard, Microsoft Sharepoint.


Now let me explain about how to install kaltura in CentOS Here i chose community edition for installtion. Before going to install Kaltura CE 5 you need to satisfy the prerequisites of Hardware and Software Requirements.

### Hardware Specifications

The Hardware requirements should vary according to the expected usage estimations. The minimum requirements to install Kaltura is as follow is


```

1 GB RAM
2GHz + Dual Core Processor (preferably Multi-Core Intel based)
5 GB Free Hard disk Space [ It depends upon the usage, but 5 GB is enough for the installation ]

```


### Software Specifications


```
Web Server ( Apache )
Database Server ( MySQL )
Mail Server ( SMTP / Postfix )
Application Packages ( Java, PHP )
Monitoring ( Xymon – This is optional)
Kaltura CE ( Main Application in tar file)
```



First we need to update the Server 

```
# yum install update

```


Install the gcc compiler 


```
# yum install gcc* -y
# yum install vim make rsync
```


### Install Apache server 


```

# yum install httpd* -y
# yum install httpd-devel -y

```


Enable the modules in Apache.conf file at follwing lines 



```

#  190 LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
#  173 LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so
#  171 LoadModule expires_module modules/mod_expires.so
#  212 LoadModule filter_module modules/mod_filter.so
#  172 LoadModule deflate_module modules/mod_deflate.so
#  168 LoadModule env_module modules/mod_env.so
#  191 LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so

```

Save and Exit from the apache.conf 


By Default There will be no file_cache module in apache we need to install it using Compiling

To get it use this below Link


```

wget http://olex.openlogic.com/content/openlogic/apache/2.2.15/openlogic-apache-2.2.15-all-src-1.zip

```

Unzip it under any were 

```

# unzip openlogic-apache-2.2.15-all-src-1.zip


```

Open the Directory 


```

# cd apache-2.2.15-src/modules/cache/


```

Install the module file_cache using Below Command


```
# apxs -i -a -c mod_file_cache.c


```


If not Its Help to install Use the below Script to get install all gcc 


```
#!/bin/sh -e

if [ `id -u` -ne 0 ];then
	echo "You need to be root for this."
	exit 1
fi
if [ `which yum 2>/dev/null` ];then
    TOOL=yum
    DEV_PACK=httpd-devel
    APACHE_VER=`rpm -q  httpd --queryformat %{version}`
elif [ `which apt-get 2>/dev/null` ];then
    TOOL=apt-get
    DEV_PACK=apache2-dev
    APACHE_VER=`dpkg -l apache2|grep ii|awk -F " " '{print $3}'|awk -F "-" '{print $1}'`
fi
TMPDIR=/tmp/compile_mod_cache_file.$$
mkdir -p $TMPDIR
$TOOL install $DEV_PACK wget gcc
wget http://archive.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-$APACHE_VER.tar.gz -O $TMPDIR/httpd-$APACHE_VER.tar.gz
tar zxf $TMPDIR/httpd-$APACHE_VER.tar.gz -C $TMPDIR/
cd $TMPDIR/httpd-$APACHE_VER/modules/cache
if [ `which apxs2 2>/dev/null` ];then
	APXS_BIN=apxs2
else
	APXS_BIN=apxs
fi
$APXS_BIN -i -a -c mod_file_cache.c
echo "Should I delete $TMPDIR? [y|n]"
read ANS
if [ "$ANS" = 'Y' -o "$ANS" = 'y' ];then
	rm -rf $TMPDIR
fi
```

Save it as script.sh then Chmod 777 and Execute as ./script.sh



Verify its Added or not by Opening the httpd.conf Configuration file 

Below Line 215 as 


```
# cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
# 216 LoadModule file_cache_module  /usr/lib64/httpd/modules/mod_file_cache.so


```


Restart the Apache


```

# /etc/init.d/httpd start

```


### PHP Installation 


PHP 5.2.x/PHP 5.3.x are supported.
Both php and php-cli must Need to Installed.
The following php extensions should be included and enabled:
fileinfo, bc, calander, date, filter, zlib, hash, mbstring, openssl, pcre, Gd, Curl, Memcache, Mysql, Mysqli, Exif, ftp, iconv, json, Session, apc (recommended), spl, DOM, SimpleXML, xml, xsl, ctype, ssh2 



```

# yum install php php-cli php-devel php-gd php-mbstring php-xml php-pecl-memcache.x86_64 php-pecl-memcached

```


Check Which Modules are installed For PHP Using command 


```

# php -m

```


If its not Available there we need to install it one by one manually 
As im Doing here below 


```
# yum install libtool
# yum install php-bcmath
# yum install memcached
# yum install php-mysql
# yum install ImageMagick
# yum install php-pecl-memcache
# yum install php-xml
# yum install fileinfo bc calander date filter zlib hash mbstring openssl pcre Gd Curl Memcache Mysql Mysqli
# yum install php-cli.x86_64 php-common.x86_64 php-dba.x86_64 php-devel.x86_64 php-embedded.x86_64 php-enchant.x86_64 php-fpm.x86_64 php-gd.x86_64 php-imap.x86_64 php-intl.x86_64 php-ldap.x86_64 php-mbstring.x86_64
# pecl install apc
```


But Need to Follow Some Steps For Enabling SSH2 and APC

Follow This Step to Get install SSH2 Module For Php

Firstly, we’re going to install the dependencies:



```
yum install gcc php-devel php-pear libssh2 libssh2-devel

```

These will allow us to build the SSH2 extension using pecl.


```
pecl install -f ssh2

```

After running that command, it should stop at a line like


```
.........done: 26,223 bytes
6 source files, building
running: phpize
Configuring for:
PHP Api Version:         20090626
Zend Module Api No:      20090626
Zend Extension Api No:   220090626
libssh2 prefix? [autodetect] :

```

All you have to do is hit Enter and it should detect the proper path. Once the install is completed, you just have to tell PHP to load the extension when it boots.

```
touch /etc/php.d/ssh2.ini
echo extension=ssh2.so > /etc/php.d/ssh2.ini
```

Now restart your webserver and test to see if the changes took effect.
And Chek The Module Installed 


```
/etc/init.d/httpd restart
php -m | grep ssh2

```


First, we need the pecl command so we can download and install APC from the repositories.

Do to so, we execute the following command:


```
# yum install pcre-devel

# yum install php-pear

```


But, this will not run on its own, we need the following package for the phpize command:


```
# yum install php-devel

```

We also need the apxs command, which is installed via the following package:

```

# yum install httpd-devel

```
Now we have all the software we need, so we install apc via the pecl command:


```

# pecl install apc 


```

Once that finishes, we need to enable apc in Apache's configuration. the following command should do this for us.


```

echo "extension=apc.so" > /etc/php.d/apc.ini


```


Then we restart Apache:


```

/etc/init.d/httpd start

```

Output Should Be Like this If not u not Done ...


```

```


Create a File info.php under www/hmtl to see weather all the php extensions were installed Properly 


```

# vim /var/www/html/info.php

```


Then Add these Codes to Get all php infos 


```
<?php phpinfo(); ?>

```

Verify that the following settings within the php.ini file are set on each server (for both php and php-cli)



For PHP 5.3: Verify that request_order parameter includes C, G and P (recommended: "CGP")
In Line 682



```

# vim /etc/php.ini

# request_order = "CGP"


```


For PHP 5.2: Verify that variables_order parameter in php.ini includes C, G and P.


Please verify that date.timezone parameter is set to the right timezone.

Have a lot for ur location Time Zone in php


```

http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.asia.php

```

Change in Line number 946


```

date.timezone = Asia/Calcutta

```

And change Longitude and Latitude too With Value 


```
date.default_latitude = 28.40
date.default_longitude = 77.13

```


### MSQL Installation 

MySQL 5.1.37 or higher

Install mysql and its Depencies , Already many of them were installed 


```

# yum install mysql mysql-server mysql-devel

```


Please verify that mysql server character set is UTF8.

```
# vim /etc/my.cnf

```

Give The Entry in these headings


```
[mysqld]
character-set-server = utf8

[client]
default-character-set=utf8

```


The following settings should be added to the my.cnf file



```
lower_case_table_names = 1
thread_stack = 262144
open_files_limit = 20000

```

Then Restart the mysql to take effect 


```

# /etc/init.d/mysqld restart


```


Output Will be like this 


```
Stopping mysqld:                                           [  OK  ]
Initializing MySQL database:  Installing MySQL system tables...
OK
Filling help tables...
OK

To start mysqld at boot time you have to copy
support-files/mysql.server to the right place for your system

PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MySQL root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:

/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h kaltura.example.com password 'new-password'

Alternatively you can run:
/usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.

```

After all Mysql Entry the Conf File looks like this 


```

[mysqld]
character-set-server = utf8
lower_case_table_names = 1
thread_stack = 262144
open_files_limit = 20000
datadir=/var/lib/mysql
socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
user=mysql
# Disabling symbolic-links is recommended to prevent assorted security risks
symbolic-links=0

[client]
default-character-set=utf8

[mysqld_safe]
log-error=/var/log/mysqld.log
pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid

```

### Set MySQL password


```

# /usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'admin123$'


```


You can login mysql by using the following command


```

# mysql -u root -p

```

These Packages Want to be installed 


```

# yum install curl
# yum install memcached
# yum install memcached libmemcached libmemcached-devel php-pecl-memcache python-memcached.noarch perl-Cache-Memcached.noarch

```

# /etc/init.d/mysqld stop

```

Then Skip the tables 


```

# mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &


```


Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /var/lib/mysql


```

# mysql -u root


```


See the Databases


```

# show databases;

```



choose the database Which we need to change 


```

# use mysql;


```

```

#  /etc/init.d/mysql restart

```


Then Login With Created Password  >>>> admin123$



```

# mysql -u root -p

```


Enter Password : 



Give ur password and get login 


### Setting Up SSL Certificate for Kaltura


For an SSL encrypted web server you will need a few things. Depending on your install you may or may not have OpenSSL and mod_ssl, Apache's interface to OpenSSL. Use yum to get them if you need them.


```

# yum install mod_ssl openssl

```

Yum will either tell you they are installed or will install them for you.


### Generate a self-signed certificate


Using OpenSSL we will generate a self-signed certificate. If you are using this on a production server you are probably likely to want a key from Trusted Certificate Authority, but if you are just using this on a personal site or for testing purposes a self-signed certificate is fine. To create the key you will need to be root so you can either su to root or use sudo in front of the commands


```
# Generate private key 
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 1024 

# Generate CSR 
openssl req -new -key ca.key -out ca.csr

# Generate Self Signed Key
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ca.csr -signkey ca.key -out ca.crt

# Copy the files to the correct locations
cp ca.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs
cp ca.key /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key
cp ca.csr /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.csr

```


Then we need to update the Apache SSL configuration file


```

vi +/SSLCertificateFile /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf


```

Change the paths to match where the Key file is stored. If you've used the method above it will be


```

SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca.crt


```


Then set the correct path for the Certificate Key File a few lines below. If you've followed the instructions above it is:


```

SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key

```


Quit and save the file and then restart Apache



```

/etc/init.d/httpd restart


```



All being well you should now be able to connect over https to your server and see a default Centos page. As the certificate is self signed browsers will generally ask you whether you want to accept the certificate. Firefox 3 won't let you connect at all but you can override this.



Edit the ssl.conf file


```

# vim /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf 


```

Enable This Two Lines 


```

# LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so

# Listen 443

# SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca.crt

# SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key


```


Then Edit the httpd configuration in 



```

# vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

```


Add this Two Lines below Line number 222
If we need only https we need to Comment the my_kaltura.conf line With #


```
# Include /opt/kaltura/app/configurations/apache/my_kaltura.conf
# Include /opt/kaltura/app/configurations/apache/my_kaltura_https.conf

```

Navigate to Kaltura httpd Configuration Directory


```

# /opt/kaltura/app/configurations/apache

```


Copy the File my_kaltura.conf and rename its to https 


```

# cp my_kaltura.conf my_kaltura_https.conf

```


Edit the File my_kaltura_https


```

# vim my_kaltura_https.conf

```

Create a new Kaltura virtual host
in my_kaltura_https.conf
Add All Below Contents in virtual Host 



```

# NameVirtualHost *:443

<VirtualHost *:80> to <VirtualHost *:443>

        <VirtualHost *:443>
        SSLEngine On
        SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca.crt
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key
```

Find the following lines by searching for “http” and change the http in the following lines to https

```

RewriteRule .*  https://my-kaltura-site.com/kmc
RewriteRule ^$  https://my-kaltura-site.com

```
Restart apache 

```

# /etc/init.d/httpd restart

```
